# EPL Survivor Pool

### NFL nerds love a good survivor pool, why shouldn't EPL dweebs also have some fun?

The general gist of the application: 

* you and some friends want to compete over something silly
* you like soccer, maybe
* you like the epl, maybe
* you like gloating, absofu**inglutely

# Summary

During the EPL season, you will pick one team each week to -NOT LOSE-. If your team does not lose, then you survive for another week. But here's the catch, you can't use that team again!

Wait a minute, there are 38 gameweeks in the EPL season and only 20 teams...

Exactamundo, Dikembe Mutombo!

In version one of these world conquering app, users will be able to select each team twice from the start. So yes, you can select Manchester City in week 1 and week 2 if your sweet heart desires. (Oops, bad example, City lost to Spurs in week 1... but you get the gist)

Every user will be in the Gen Pop pool, but you can also set up private leagues for you and your dorky friends!
